				<h3>Immigration in the U.S. Since 1820</h3>
				<div id="Part1aVis"></div>
				<div><h4>Analysis</h4>
					<ul class="sources"><li>The number of persons obtaining permanent resident status shows the surge of immigration in the 1800's and early 1900's. We see a sharp drop in immigration during the World Wars and a peak corresponding to the Immigration Act of 1990. The other populations have not been tracked for as long, but there is an interesting trend of refugee arrivals decreasing during the 1990's while the number of asylum seekers rose.</li></ul>

						<li><a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/historic.html">U.S. Census - Current Population Survey</a>, 1981 - 2016, yearly. Number of new residents from foreign country.</li>

				<div><h4>Analysis</h4>
					<ul class="sources">
					<li>We can see that a number of states are the most common attractors for movers from from abroad of all types. These include California, Florida, New York, and Texas which are also the most populous states.</li>
					<li>Overall non-immigrant admissions have been greater in the 2010's than the previous decade, with Nevada being a popular destination despite its relatively smaller population size. There may have been an increase in gambling tourism during this decade.</li>
					<li>People on student visas have been attracted to states with excellent universities, including Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. These same states have had high incomes per capita in the last two years.</li>
					<li>Work visas mostly correspond with populous states, although Michigan sticks out as having a greater number of migrant workers from 2009 to 2014. This is interesting as in the national unemployment rates peaked in 2010 and were particularly bad in Michigan, along with North and South Carolina, Florida, California, and Nevada.</li>
					<li>Violent crime has been decreasing, especially along the East Coast, but is still high in Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee. Property crime has not changed much over the time frame, but is high in Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, and Seattle. Regions which appear unattractive to immigrations, such as the Deep South and the Great Plains, are struggling regions with high poverty and household food security rates.</li>
